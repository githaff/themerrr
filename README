This is simple Theme ReReadeR tool. It allows to change themes of such
frameworks like GTK+ or Qt on-the-fly.

This tool is a product of vivisection on the GTK+ and Qt frameworks but it does
not depends on them. Instead it reproduses some manipulations on the xlib-level
which causes this two frameworks to reread their config files.


Examples:

Pring brief help
$ themerrr --help

Reread both gtk and qt configs
$ themerrr

Do not reread gtk config
$ themerrr --no-gtk

Do not reread qt config
$ themerrr --no-qt
